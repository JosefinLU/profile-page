      <h2>Top 3 things that I'm great at:</h2>
      <h3>1. Building relationships</h3>
      <p>
        To make a team great requires work and investment. Building good
        relationships with co-workers is something I consider a key priority.
      </p>
      <h3>2. Coding</h3>
      <p>
        I have the strength to keep going even when it feels hopeless, continue
        the progress of learning and develop. At my current job, the tech stack
        I work with includes: Git, BIF, SQL, SSMS, Visual studio, Azure DevOps,
        TraceView, VB code, .Net and C#.
      </p>
      <p>
        Skills in progress: JavaScript, Node.js, Vue, React. Currently I’m
        mainly creating projects in JavaScript (who doesn't want to build a
        Dragon 2 like Elon Musk at SpaceX!?).

        <p>
          I work in a big company together with colleges from different parts of
          the world. We develop a comprehensive product, with many modules. I
          mainly work with upgrades of the system that we offer, which is based
          on .Net. It is a job where I have fairly close contact with the
          customer and the users. My role consists in providing customization of
          our product based on our customer's needs. To a large extent the
          customization is developed via frontend, where I have learned a
          completely new and unique language, the company's own language - BIF.
          My job also includes frequent work related to meta and databses as
          well deliveries of packages to different environments. I have gathered
          various experiences, among BIF, SQL, migration of data, C#, DLLs, VB
          code through the upgrades we are responsible for, this work is
          performed according to GDPR. I work daily in Git, Visual Stuido,
          Visual code, TraceView, Azure DevOps and my team is leveraging agile
          methodologies as much as we can.
